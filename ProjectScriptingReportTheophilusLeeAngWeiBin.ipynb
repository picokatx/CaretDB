However, we find that Sentry is more concerned with modelling the high level interactions of users with websites, for use in debugging. On the other hand, we believe that there is value in desiging a low level model of user browsing behaviour. Complex interactions between a user and a website cannot always be captured on a high level interpretation. For instance, Sentry's capability to interface with video controls has the following problems: a website front-end designer may decide that serving videos in a custom element is suitable. In that case, Sentry may face issues recording use of video control. However, a recording of only low level user input (click, drag, etc) will form a consistent pattern that is indenpendant of website implementation. Therefore, there are benefits to our approach over Sentry's.\n\nWe take inspiration from the work produced by this recent paper: https://huggingface.co/datasets/McGill-NLP/WebLINX. WebLINX has opened new doorways when it comes to training on browsing data, allowing AI models to mimic human browsing. However, the data collected is still on a small scale and is fairly complex to handle. A database management system designed solely for gathering user browsing data can streamline the process of data collection and inference. Hence, the database is useful in real life context.\n\n**Goals**\n\n- Allow users to record their browsing sessions in-system to be uploaded to the database.\n- Allow researchers to conduct research efficiently.\n- Allow database administrators the power to manage database.\n\n**Target Users**\n\nThe database application's target audience are data science researchers, specifically, people specializing in web analytics or clickstream Analytics. UX Researchers may also find use in our database.\n\n_Data Science Researchers_ \n- Easier to observe patterns in low level inputs than inputs that may have more complex meaning. <mark>By storing information about inputs in a easily accessible format, researchers will be able to easily access and analyze the data. Researchers can easily filter out precisely what data they want to look at at apply operations by using the search function of the database. In specific, consider if we were to store the raw requests captured by the browser, a higher level interpretation of the communication between user and server through the browser. Constructing complex queries would require us to first dissect the meaning of requests, an issue that a low level representation will not face. </mark>\n\n_UX Researchers_\n- Useful for understanding how design tokens affect user interaction. <mark>The researchers can query from the database information about interactions related to specific parts of the UI to determine how changes influence user interaction. This is important for the case of design tokens, which operate at the level of System tokens, which determine basic attributes such as color and typography, to Component tokens which determine how the UI is composed. A low level representation allows us to take a bottom up approach to understanding how design tokens affect user interaction.</mark>\n\n_Machine Learning_\n- While we do not address directly, it is certainly possible to train models on our database. <mark>Our database gives a way to store user interaction data in a way that is easily inputable into a machine. This means that interested people can easily use it to train machine learning models related to user inputs.</mark>\n\n\n**Justification for using RDBMS**\n- On a high level understanding, the entities associated with a browsing session are highly related with each other. For example, a user click is inherently associated with a web page that the user is browsing on, and the html element that the user clicks on, and of course, the user click is associated with a user. This forms a rigid relationship between entities that we find is most efficiently represented by a relational schema. \n- A Relational Database Management System favours scaling vertically (i.e. adding more server resources). This is ideal as our users consist mainly of individual researchers who are likely to have such a system, rather than a large audience of concurrent consumers accessing the database, in which case horizontal scaling would be preferred.\n- A researcher would benefit from the greater ease of performing join queries in database management systems.\n- A consistent schema is beneficial for tracking historical user data (i.e. we can still perform research across many years since the base schema does not change)","block_group":"6e056a560480496ea4d6753be7f19c44"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"deepnote_app_block_order":11,"deepnote_app_block_visible":true,"deepnote_app_block_group_id":null,"cell_id":"6caa115fc9ce449881daf5abde42e3f7","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"### Section B: Business Rules","block_group":"e0d4c717911c45f0b9e0c0801928e81f"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"deepnote_app_block_order":12,"deepnote_app_block_visible":true,"deepnote_app_block_group_id":null,"cell_id":"16afbeeb71fa4ad487332a107346098f","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\nInclude your updated Business Rules writeup here.

We are not considering this for the database.\n\n**Users**\nUsers are website accounts. Users contain an email address, user id, username, password, <mark>date and time of account creation, date and time of last login, status of account (whether the account is enabled or disabled), full name, phone number, role as either user or admin, whether email has been verified, number of failed login attempts and whether 2FA is enabled</mark>. the email address is further split into email name and email domain. <mark>The name is further split into first name, middle name and last name.</mark> A User is capable of creating many Replays. A User may create no Replays, and every Replay must be created by a User.\n\n\n**Replay**\nReplays contain a snapshot of a recorded browsing session. UserEvents may take place in a Replay. A Replay may contain many UserEvents. A Replay can have no UserEvents. 2 Replays cannot contain the same UserEvent. \n\n<mark>This is because a Replay represents a recorded session that doesnt not overlap with other Replays. This also makes sure information about a UserEvent is not duplicated.</mark>\n\nEvery Replay must contain exactly one of each of the following: unique replay id, time, browser agent, device type, device os, user ip address, default viewport. <mark>We have determined that these are key attributes that are shared across a wide variety of browser sessions, and therefore we do not list other capturable data in our database. </mark>default viewport represents the dimensions of the viewport, and is further subdivided into width and height. <mark>We do note that we could further constraint the viewport size to a preset list of valid viewport sizes, since it is known what screen resolutions exist and it is a common standard. However, we choose not to impose this constraint to future-proof our database design. </mark>. IP address is further divided into network id and host id in accordance to ip address format. Device Operating system is further split into os type and os version. Browser agent is the User-Agent header provided by the browser and is further subdivided into product, product version and comment, following user agent schema. time is split into the starting time and the ending time. All time is measured in milliseconds elapsed since the UNIX epoch. \n\n**UserEvent**\nThe database stores information about user events, where each UserEvent is an atomic browser action issued by a device due to user input. We will not be considering script-triggered events/inputs for this database. UserEvents are associated with Replays<mark>, becauase UserEvents only have meaning when they are performed on a browser, i.e. on a Replay</mark>. Every UserEvent must have a Replay<mark>, because without a Replay a UserEvent has no meaning</mark>. Many UserEvents can be associated with the same Replay<mark>Since a user can perform many actions on the same browser</mark>. UserEvents have a timestamp. Timestamps are measured in milliseconds elapsed since the UNIX epoch. Since it is reasonable to assume that a user cannot perform 2 inputs in the same millisecond, we can say that any 2 UserEvent timestamps are unique within a Replay. However, 2 UserEvent timestamps from 2 different Replays are not guaranteed to be unique Each UserEvent also has 1 status determining the state of the action. The possible states are <mark>complete, active, timeout<mark>. Each UserEvent must contain a viewport width and height<mark>since browsers can resize and we must account for the relative positioning</mark>. A UserEvent results in a Webstate. Every UserEvent must have a Webstate. Only 1 Webstate can be associated with a UserEvent<mark>, since a user cannot perform an action that affects 2 different browsers</mark>. There are many types of UserEvents. The types in consideration are 'NavigateEvent', 'ElementEvent'. Not every UserEvent must be one of the types, and a UserEvent may only have 1 type. \n\n**NavigateEvent**\nSome user events involve a change in route or domain of the web page, or in other words, a change in URL. We define these events to be called NavigateEvents. NavigateEvents are a type of UserEvent. NavigateEvents must contain at most 1 URL<mark>, since a user cannot go to 2 different websites at the same time</mark>. Every NavigateEvent must have a URL<mark>, since a user must be going to a website to navigate</mark>. \n\n**ElementEvent**\nSome user events may involve 1 or more elements. We define these events to be called ElementEvents. ElementEvents are a type of UserEvent. ElementEvents have participating Elements. Not every ElementEvent has participating Elements. An ElementEvent may be associated with more than 1 Element. Many ElementEvents may be associated with the same Element<mark>, since a user may for instance, click or drag the same button multiple times</mark>. There are many types of ElementEvents. The types in consideration are 'TextEvent', 'MoveEvent', 'ClickEvent'. Not every ElementEvent must be one of the types, and an ElementEvent may only have 1 type<mark>, since if a user were to perform a click and a drag at the same time, we would consider them as 2 separate events.</mark>. \n\n**TextEvent**\nTextEvent describes a change in text on a web page due to user or scripted input. TextEvents are a type of ElementEvent. TextEvents have new text to update the participating elements with. TextEvents must have a new text. \n\n**ClickEvent**\nClickEvent describes a click input on a web page. ClickEvents are a type of ElementEvent. Each ClickEvent must contain x and y click coordinates. Each ClickEvent has a mouse button id. This corresponds to either the left, right, or middle mouse button. Each ClickEvent must have a mouse button id. Each ClickEvent must contain only 1 mouse button id<mark>, since an input device for clicking (a mouse) may not input both a left and right click at the same time, only one after the other</mark>. \n\n**MoveEvent**\nMoveEvent describes a movement of the cursor on the web page. MoveEvents are a type of ElementEvent. Each MoveEvent must contain exactly 1 x begin and y begin scroll coordinates. Each MoveEvent must contain exactly 1 x end and y end scroll coordinates. There are many types of MoveEvents. The types in consideration are 'ScrollEvent', 'DragEvent'. A MoveEvent may be either, none, or both of these types<mark>This is because a user may scroll and drag on a web page at the same time</mark>. \n\n**ScrollEvent**\nScrollEvent describes a scroll input on a web page. ScrollEvents are a type of MoveEvent. ScrollEvents must contain the distance scrolled horizontally and vertically. This is stored as a fraction of the page width and height respectively. ScrollEvents may only scroll a participating element<mark>This is because browsers keep track of the context that our user is interacting with the DOM, and will only scroll the context that our user is interacting with, which is our participating element</mark>.\n\n\n**DragEvent**\nDragEvent describes a change in the position of the web page, with a mouse button in the down state. DragEvents are a type of MoveEvent. Each DragEvent begins and ends when the mouse button is pressed and released. DragEvents are a type of MoveEvent. Each DragEvent may only drag a participating element on the web page<mark>This is because, again, browsers keep track of the context that our user is interacting with the DOM, and will only drag the context that our user is interacting with, which is our participating element</mark>.\n\n**Element**\nElements are entities that represent the elements on the website that the user interacts with. These entities are cherry picked heuristically to be relevant to user interaction<mark>, because websites often have many elements that are not relevant to user interaction, such as metadata or stylesheets</mark>. Elements may participate in ElementEvents. Many Elements can participate in many ElementEvents. Not every Element must participate in ElementEvents<mark>, since not all elements have an interaction function for the user</mark>. Elements are also contained within a Webstate. Many Elements may be contained within a webstate. 2 Webstates may contain the same element, <mark>, since 2 webstates may be 2 slightly different iterations of the same replay, and hence may contain the same element</mark>. An Element must be contained in a Webstate. Elements have uids. Any 2 Elements within a Webstate will not share uids<mark>. This ensures entity integrity</mark>. 2 Elements from different Webstates may share the same uid<mark>, since 2 webstates may be 2 iterations of the same replay</mark>. An element has an element_id used as a key. An element must have 1 tag referring to its html element tag. All valid HTML tags are valid tags<mark>, including deprecated tags, so as to preserve backwards compatibility</mark>. Elements contain a xpath which identifies location of element in the page by traversing the DOM. XPath is needed in calculating the element order.Elements contain text which represent the text content in the html element. Elements contain an uid. Bounding boxes are further divided into x and y coordinates and a height and width<mark>, since all interactable html elements have a defined bounding box within the DOM</mark>. Elements may also contain many html attributes. Elements also contain a z_index, which identifies the layer on which the Elements exists on the web page. \n\n**Cookies**\nCookies store website information used for authentication and user tracking among other uses. Cookies are associated with Webstates. Many Cookies may be associated with many Webstates<mark>, since cookies persist across the website and path</mark>. Cookies must be associated with a Webstate. Any 2 Webstates may contain the same Cookie. Cookies have a unique name. <mark>This ensures there is entity integrity. </mark> Cookies store whether they are secure, whether they are http_only and whether they are from the same site. Cookies store the following attributes: size, expiry, path, domain, value. Cookies store when they were last accessed.\n\n**Webstate**\nWebstates store minified html web pages. Webstates may contain Cookies. Many Webstates may contain many Cookies. Webstates may contain no Cookies. 2 Webstates may contain the same Cookie. Webstates are associated with a UserEvent. Not every Webstate must have a Userevent. Every Webstate must contain at most 1 UserEvent. 2 Webstates may not contain the same UserEvent. Webstates contain Elements. Each Webstate contains many elements. Each Webstate must contain at least 1 element. 2 Webstates may not contain the same element. A Webstate has a html hash. This stores the hash of the minified html of the web page. The hash is guaranteed to be unique<mark>, since it is unlikely that there will be a hash collision for 2 different web pages</mark>. Webstates contain a html filepath, which locates the physical minified html file on a LFS system, and is composed of a base path concatenated to the html hash.\n\n**Participating Elements**\nElements that participate in ElementEvents have an Element Order.

We will explain them here.\n\nEventParticipatingElements Entity can be observed to have a composite key composing 4 key attributes. This is result of the following: ElementEvent and Element are related in a M to N relationship, with Element being a weak entity, and ElementEvent inheriting from a weak entity. Therefore, we first use Mapping of Binary M:N Relationship Types to define EventParticipatingElements, containing weak keys timestamp and uid from ElementEvent and Element respectively. Then, we use Mapping of Weak Entity Types to include the respective strong keys, html_hash and replay_id.\n\nThere is also the high volume of weak entities present in the relational model and subsequently ER diagram. This is because in a webpage, most elements (cookies, html elements, events) have no meaning when taken out of their context (webpage). Therefore, it is necessary to represent this in the relational model. For instance,  UserEvent is inherently dependent on context (Replay) to exist within the subject domain.\n\n**Specialization and Generalization**\n_UserEvent_ is a superentity of NavigateEvent and ElementEvent. We chose the Multiple Relations-superclass and subclasses method for convertion to Relational Model. This is for the following reasons:\nThere are many possible input events, even on a low level interpretation, due to the wide range of input devices not covered here (pressure-sensitive touchpad, controller, etc.). Therefore, it is important to allow for ease of extension of the relational model. To achieve this, we must have a Generic UserEvent to offer minimal functionality for subclasses not defined in our relational model, which can then be updated to a specific subclass in the relational model when needed. \nAlso, it is important to note that events in Javascript are typically handled in a JSON-like format, and each only contain used attributes. Therefore, single relation with type attribute or 1 hot encoded attribute are not appropriate, since it will create unnecessary null values in the database, wasting space. \n\n_ElementEvent_ is a superentity of ClickEvent, TextEvent and MoveEvent. We chose the Multiple Relations-superclass and subclasses method. This is for the following reasons:\nThe same reasons from UserEvent will also apply here. Additionally, ElementEvent subclasses often contain position attributes, which may be confused with each other if they are combined into 1 relation.\n\n_MoveEvent_ is a superentity of DragEvent and ScrollEvent. We chose the Multiple Relations-superclass and subclasses method. This is for the following reasons:\nThe same reasons from UserEvent will also apply here.
