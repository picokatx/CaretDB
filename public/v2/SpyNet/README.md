- Database Management System for the WebLinx Project https://huggingface.co/datasets/McGill-NLP/WebLINX
#### Assignment Requirements
- WebLINX has opened new doorways when it comes to training on browsing data, allowing AI models to mimic human browsing. However, the data collected is still on a small scale and is fairly complex to handle. A database management system designed solely for gathering user browsing data can streamline the process of data collection and inference. Hence, the database is useful in real life context.
- The data is suitable for storage in a relational database (see data table in website).
#### Running the Website Locally
